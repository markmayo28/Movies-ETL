# Movies-ETL

## Overview of Project

Amazing Prime (a notional company) is sponsoring a hackathon to merge some movie data sets from divergent sources in order to see user rating data and make determinations on which movies to carry on their streaming service. We will be pulling this data together and merging it into an SQL database for the hackathon participants.

Once the SQL database is created, Amazing Prime wants us to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.  This will allow for easy iterations of the data for future use.
